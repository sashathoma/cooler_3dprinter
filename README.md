a 3d printer that can be heated with a peltier device but also cooled


I tried to wire up this motherboard to this LCD screen, eventually able to get it together using the pin out in sheet

Wiring up the duet Mini 3 5 plus helped but was not great because we do not have an LCD for it

The heated bed would not heat up because the thermistor was not connected to the MKS properly so I  I attempted to Pivot to the duet Mini 3 


I later found an LCD screen for the duet Mini 3 and attempted to wire it up but every time I wired it up it would begin to heat up very quickly

I found several YouTube videos to help me wire the LCD screen

All of these videos are talking about how the duet Mini 3 works or how the LCD screen for it works
